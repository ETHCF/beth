# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This repository tracks the `main` branch. We accept reports against the latest code on `main` and the most recent tagged release (if any).

## Reporting a Vulnerability (Responsible Disclosure)
- Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.
- Preferred: GitHub Security Advisory
  1. Go to the repo “Security” tab → “Advisories” → “Report a vulnerability”.
  2. Include a minimal reproducible description, potential impact, and (if possible) a PoC/test.
- Alternate: Email zcole@linux.com

Acknowledgement targets: response within 3 business days, triage within 7 business days. If confirmed, we will coordinate a fix, testing, and disclosure timeline with you. Please allow reasonable time for remediation before public disclosure.

## Scope
- In-scope: contracts in `src/`.
- Out-of-scope for bounties but welcome as quality issues: tests, scripts, documentation.

## Guidelines
- Follow responsible disclosure, minimize risk to users and funds.
- Do not exploit beyond what’s necessary to demonstrate impact.
- Comply with applicable laws.

## Disclosure
We publish advisories and changelogs as needed. Reporters may choose to be credited.
